##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Sample Superstore retail dataset** using Microsoft Excel.  
The main goal was to convert raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through interactive dashboards.

Two dashboards were created:

- **Sales Performance Dashboard**
- **Return Analysis Dashboard**

These dashboards help to analyze sales trends, profitability, regional performance, and product return behavior in a simple and visual manner.

---

##  Problem Statement

Retail organizations generate huge amounts of data daily. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to understand:

- Which categories and products drive the most revenue  
- Which regions contribute the highest sales  
- When sales peak during the year  
- Why profit margins are low in some areas  
- From where and why product returns are happening  

This project aims to solve these problems by building structured and interactive Excel dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

---

##  Dataset

**Dataset Used:** Sample Superstore Dataset  
**Domain:** Retail / E-Commerce  
**Data Type:** Transactional Sales Data  

The dataset includes:

- Order details  
- Sales and profit values  
- Product categories and subcategories  
- Regional and customer information  
- Product return details  

The dataset was already clean and structured, so no additional data transformation was required.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel  
- Power Query  
- Power Pivot  
- Pivot Tables  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Charts and Slicers  

---

##  Methods & Steps Performed

The following steps were performed to build this project:

1. Imported Sample Superstore dataset into Excel  
2. Verified data quality (data was already clean)  
3. Created relationships between tables using Power Pivot  
4. Built calculated measures using DAX formulas  
5. Created Pivot Tables for analysis  
6. Designed interactive dashboards using:
   - KPIs  
   - Charts  
   - Slicers  
   - Filters  
7. Implemented **dynamic page navigation** between dashboards  
8. Analyzed insights from sales and return data

#  Business Insights & Key Findings

---

###  Key Findings – Sales Analysis

**1. Top Performing Categories**

- **Technology**  
  - Sales: **$836K**  
  - Profit: **$145.5K**

- **Furniture**  
  - Sales: **$742K**  
  - Profit: **$18.5K**

 Although Furniture is the second highest revenue-generating category, its profit is extremely low compared to Technology, indicating a major profitability issue.

---

**2. Best Performing Subcategories**

- Phones: **$330K**  
- Chairs: **$328K**

These two subcategories are the biggest revenue drivers.

---

**3. Top Performing States**

- California: **$458K**  
- New York: **$311K**  
- Texas: **$170K**

 These three states together generate **approximately one-third of total revenue**, making them the most critical markets.

---

**4. Sales Trend Analysis**

- Highest sales occur between **September and December**
- Peak months are mainly:
  - September  
  - November  
  - December  

This clearly indicates strong seasonal demand toward the end of the year.

---

###  Key Findings – Return Analysis

**1. Returns by Region**

- The **West Region contributes to more than half of total returns**
- This region shows an unusually high return rate and needs immediate attention

---

**2. Returns by Ship Mode**

- **Same-Day Shipping** and **First-Class Shipping** have the highest return rates  
- Faster delivery options seem to face more operational or quality issues

---

**3. Returns by Products**

- Certain products appear repeatedly in the top return list  
- This indicates possible:
  - Quality problems  
  - Expectation mismatch  
  - Incorrect product descriptions  

---

#  Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended:

---

### 1. Improve Profitability of Furniture Category

Although Furniture generates high sales, profit is extremely low. The company should:

- Review pricing strategies  
- Reduce heavy discounting  
- Optimize supply chain costs  
- Analyze cost vs margin structure  

---

### 2. Leverage Peak Sales Months

Since maximum sales occur between September to December, the company should:

- Plan targeted promotions during these months  
- Increase inventory before the peak season  
- Strengthen marketing campaigns  
- Improve logistics planning  

Also analyze why sales remain low in other months.

---

### 3. Focus on High-Return West Region

As the West region contributes to more than half of total returns, the company should:

- Investigate root causes  
- Improve product quality checks  
- Analyze customer complaints  
- Strengthen packaging and delivery processes  

---

### 4. Improve Fast Shipping Operations

High return rates in Same-Day and First-Class shipping suggest operational issues. To reduce this:

- Strengthen quality checks before dispatch  
- Improve packaging standards  
- Reduce rushed order processing errors  
- Monitor reasons for returns specific to fast shipping  

---

### 5. Address High-Return Products

Products with frequent returns should be:

- Reviewed for defects  
- Re-evaluated for description accuracy  
- Considered for redesign or discontinuation  

---

##  How to Run This Project

- Download and open the Excel dashboard file  
- Click **Enable Content** if prompted  
- Use slicers to filter data dynamically  
- Navigate between dashboards using **page navigation buttons**  
- Fully interactive user experience  

---

##  Result & Conclusion

This project successfully transformed raw retail data into structured dashboards that help to:

- Understand sales performance clearly  
- Identify profitable and non-profitable areas  
- Recognize seasonal trends  
- Analyze return behavior  
- Support data-driven decision making  

The dashboards provide actionable insights that can help businesses improve revenue, profitability, and operational efficiency.
