#  Retail Sales & Returns Analysis Dashboard | Excel Project

##  Objective

To analyze retail sales and return performance using interactive Excel dashboards and provide actionable business insights for better decision-making.

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Sample Superstore retail dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights through dashboards.

Two interactive dashboards were built:

- Sales Performance Dashboard  
- Return Analysis Dashboard  

These dashboards help visualize key business metrics such as sales trends, profit performance, regional performance, and product return behavior.

---

##  Problem Statement

Retail businesses generate large amounts of transactional data daily, but without proper analysis, it is difficult to understand:

- Which categories and products drive the most revenue  
- Which regions perform best  
- When sales peak during the year  
- Where profit margins are low  
- Why returns are happening and from where  

This project aims to solve these problems by creating structured dashboards that help management take data-driven decisions.

- **Type:** Retail transactional data  

**Records Include:**

- Order details  
- Sales values  
- Profit values  
- Customer and region information

- Power Query  
- Power Pivot  
- Pivot Tables  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

1. Imported the Sample Superstore dataset into Excel  
2. Verified data quality (no cleaning required)  
3. Created relationships between tables using Power Pivot  
4. Built calculated measures using DAX formulas  
5. Created Pivot Tables for analysis  
6. Designed interactive dashboards using:  
   - Charts  
   - Slicers

##  Business Insights & Key Findings

### Key Findings – Sales Analysis

#### 1. Top Performing Categories

- **Technology**  
  - Sales: **$836K**  
  - Profit: **$145.5K**

- **Furniture**  
  - Sales: **$742K**  
  - Profit: **$18.5K**

Although Furniture is the second highest revenue-generating category, its profit is extremely low compared to Technology. This highlights a major profitability concern.

---

#### 2. Best Performing Subcategories

- **Phones:** $330K  
- **Chairs:** $328K  

These two subcategories are the biggest revenue drivers of the business.

---

#### 3. Top Performing States

- **California:** $458K  
- **New York:** $311K  
- **Texas:** $170K  

These three states together generate approximately **one-third of total revenue**, making them the most critical markets for the business.

---

#### 4. Sales Trend Analysis

- Highest sales are observed between **September and December**  
- Peak sales occur mostly in:  
  - September  
  - November  
  - December  

This indicates strong seasonal demand toward the end of the year.

---

### Key Findings – Return Analysis

#### 1. Returns by Region

- The **West Region** contributes to more than **one-half of total product returns**  
- This region shows an unusually high return rate and needs immediate attention  

---

#### 2. Returns by Ship Mode

- **Same-Day Shipping** and **First-Class Shipping** have the highest return rates  
- Faster delivery options seem to have more quality or fulfillment issues  

---

#### 3. Returns by Products

Certain products repeatedly appear in the top return list, indicating:

- Possible quality problems  
- Customer expectation mismatch  
- Incorrect product descriptions  

---

##  Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

### 1. Improve Profitability of Furniture Category

- Review pricing strategy  
- Reduce unnecessary discounts  
- Analyze cost structure  
- Optimize supply chain and logistics  
- Analyze high discount rates applied to Furniture products and evaluate their impact on profit margins  

Despite high sales, the very low profit in Furniture requires immediate strategic review.

---

### 2. Leverage Peak Sales Months

Since maximum sales occur from **September to December**, the company should:

- Plan targeted promotions  
- Increase inventory before these months  
- Strengthen marketing campaigns  
- Optimize staffing and logistics  

Additionally, analyze why other months show lower sales and identify underperforming regions.

---

### 3. Focus on West Region Returns

As the West region contributes to more than half of total returns, the company should:

- Investigate root causes in this region  
- Analyze product quality issues  
- Improve packaging and delivery processes  
- Monitor customer feedback  

---

### 4. Improve Fast Shipping Operations

High returns in Same-Day and First-Class shipping suggest operational problems.

To reduce this:

- Strengthen quality checks before dispatch  
- Improve packaging standards  
- Reduce rushed order processing errors  
- Analyze return reasons specific to fast shipping modes  

---

### 5. Address High-Return Products

Products with frequent returns should be:

- Reviewed for defects  
- Re-evaluated for description accuracy  
- Considered for improvement or discontinuation  

---

##  Result & Conclusion

This project successfully converted raw retail data into meaningful dashboards that help in:

- Understanding sales performance  
- Identifying profitable and non-profitable areas  
- Recognizing seasonal trends  
- Analyzing return behavior  

The dashboards enable management to make **data-driven strategic decisions** and improve overall business performance.
