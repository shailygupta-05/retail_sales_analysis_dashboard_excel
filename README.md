#  PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes the **Sample Superstore retail dataset** using Microsoft Excel to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights.
Two interactive dashboards were created:
- **Sales Performance Dashboard**  
- **Return Analysis Dashboard**
 
These dashboards help visualize sales trends, profitability, regional performance, and return behavior in an easy and structured format.

---
#  PROBLEM STATEMENT

Retail businesses generate huge amounts of data daily, but without analysis it is difficult to understand:
- Which categories and products drive the most revenue  
- Which regions perform best  
- When sales peak during the year  
- Why profit margins are low in some areas  
- Where and why product returns are happening  

This project solves these problems by building structured and interactive Excel dashboards for data-driven decisions.
